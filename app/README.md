# ShadowBook Frontend

This directory will contain the minimal frontend interface for ShadowBook.

The UI will demonstrate:

- Opening an encrypted position
- Viewing current market price
- Running private liquidation checks
- Displaying final PnL settlement

The goal is not to build a full exchange UI.

The goal is to clearly show how Arcium enables private computation in perps trading.
